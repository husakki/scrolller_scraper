# scrolller_scraper
## Info
This is a Webscraper for the website: scrolller.com  
It scrapes the images of a url.. wow  
   
I think it it much more simple than a reddit scraper, but on reddit you could 
get the API and more recent post etc. anyways this was quite a fun project.

## Usage
```python
# install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# The output_path is [optional]
python3 main.py <url> <requested_image_amount> [<output_path>]
```
Then the images will be downladed into the *output_path* or a default directory will be created called *"images/"*

### First Fork ðŸŽ‰
I actually just continued the project because I had my first fork on this repo by somebody and I felt a bit bad about the state of it. So I did some changes, made it better and hopefully more usable for others too.  
I might even add features like downlading videos or so :)
